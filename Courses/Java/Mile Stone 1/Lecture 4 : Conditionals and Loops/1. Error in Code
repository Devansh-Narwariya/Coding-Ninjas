What is the error in this code?

byte b = 50;
b = b * 50;

Options
This problem has only one correct answer
a) b can not contain value 2500, limited by its range
b) * operator has converted b * 50 into int, which can not be converted to byte without casting
c) b can not contain value 50
d) No error in this code

Solution
b) * operator has converted b * 50 into int, which can not be converted to byte without casting

Solution Description
In 2nd statement, b is multiplied with 50 where b is byte variable and 50 is an integer. 
So after the multiplication, result comes as an integer value which is 2500. 
Now we are trying to assign this integer to a byte variable, which will cause the error.
