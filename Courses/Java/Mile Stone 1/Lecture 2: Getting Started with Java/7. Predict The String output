Options
This problem has only one correct answer

a) Coding Ninjas
b) Coding
c) Ninjas
d) The above code fragment does not compile

Solution
b) Coding

Solution Description
"s.next()" returns the next token as String. 
A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline. 
So when input line is - “Coding Ninjas” then s.next() returns the first token i.e. “Coding”
