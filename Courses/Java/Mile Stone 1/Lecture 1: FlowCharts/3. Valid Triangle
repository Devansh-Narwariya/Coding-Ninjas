You are given 3 numbers. 
Each number represents the length of a line. 
You need to figure out whether these lines can form a valid triangle.
If a valid triangle can be formed, print "Yes", otherwise print "No".
Draw a flowchart for this process
A triangle is a valid triangle, If and only If, the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. 
For Example, let A, B and C are three sides of a triangle. Then, A + B > C, B + C > A and C + A > B
